Arduino Simplified - v4 ResNet
==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on April 21, 2022 at 2:52 PM GMT

It includes 296 images.
Arduinos are annotated in folder format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 224x224 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -25 and +25 degrees
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -5 and +5 percent
